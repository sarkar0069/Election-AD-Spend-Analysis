# Election-AD-Spend-Analysis
In this project, we perform elections ad spending analysis using Python  and how it impacted the voting patterns.

All the parties in India usually spend a lot of money on election campaigns. I recently collected data from Meta ads about how much money was spent on Instagram and Facebook ads by each political party during the Indian elections 2024 in each state.
